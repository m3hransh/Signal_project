\section{Plotting Signals}
\subsection{Q1.1}
In this section, I show you how to implement \textbf{unit step}
 and \textbf{impulse} function and how to plot them 
 with the different sampling rates with the use of 
 \textbf{Numpy} and \textbf{Matplotlib} in python.
\subsubsection{Unit Step}

\paragraph{} Unit step is a signal with magnitude one for time greater than zero . We can assume it as a dc signal which got switched on at time equal to zero.
this is the mathematical definition of unit step:

 \begin{align}
  x(t) = \begin{cases}
   0 &: t<0\\
   1 &: t\geq 0\end{cases}
 \end{align}

 \paragraph{}The unit step function as it is shown in the
  \textbf{Listing \ref{list:unit_step}}, takes one \textbf{Numpy} 
  array or simple list as an input(samples of the time) and then
  return a list of output. this is list comprehension in 
  Python that iterates through time samples and for each 
  time samples if the sample is less than 0 it returns 
  0 and otherwise returns 1(this is the exact definition 
  of the unit step function).

\paragraph{}for the next part, we are using the function that was defined to 
plot the diagrams for sampling rates of  $F_s=100$ and 
$F_s=1000$(\textbf{Listing \ref{list:q1_1_unit}}). the code is 
straightforward. first, it makes two grid in a row, and gets 
two axes and drawing the unit function with $F_s=100$ in the 
first axis and $F_s=1000$ in the second one. plots is shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:Q1-1-unit}}.

\subsubsection{Impulse}
\paragraph{}The pulse function, also called the impulse function, 
in DT is easy: everywhere zero except at n=0 where the 
values is 1. The DT pulse is written as $\delta[n]$.

In CT it is more difficult. The pulse in CT is written 
as $\delta(t)$. It is mathematically defined with the sifting property:

\begin{align}
x(0) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t)\delta(t)dt
\end{align}

\paragraph{}A usefull way to think about a pulse signal 
is to consider a signal in which you want to concentrate 
a finite amount of energy in a short a time interval as 
possible. Energy in a signal is measured by integrating a 
signal over a period of time.

Consider for instance the signal $x_a(t)$ defined as:

\begin{align}    
\begin{split}x_a(t) = \begin{cases}
       \frac{1}{2a} &: -a \leq t \leq a\\
       0 &: \text{elsewhere}
       \end{cases}\end{split}
\end{align}

\paragraph{}The total energy in this signal is 1 
(the integral of $x(t)$ over the entire domain). 
This is true irrespective of the value of a. In the 
limit when $a\rightarrow 0$ the value $x_a(0)\rightarrow \infty$ but still the total 
area under the function remains 1. In a sloppy way we 
may define:
\[
    \delta(t) = \lim_{a\rightarrow0} x_a(t)
    \]
\paragraph{}For the implementation of the Impulse signal in python, 
we are using this sloppy definition. Because even for 
plotting continuous-time signals in python, we use 
an array of time samples. So we are going to implement 
the Impulse approximately by considering our sampling rate.

\paragraph{}The implementation has shown in 
\textbf{Listing \ref{list:impulse}}. The function takes four inputs. 
The first one is the array or list of time samples, 
the second and third ones are low-bound and upper-bound 
of the time samples and the fourth one is the number of 
sampling. The function uses these arguments in addition 
to the first one(array of time samples) to find the 
closest samples to zero in lesser time that is needed. 
after finding those time samples create the smallest 
rectangular signal in a way that its integral becomes 1.
