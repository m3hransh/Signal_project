\section{Systems}
In this section, a system has been defined. 
The definition has been shown below:
\begin{align}
    y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{u-t}x(u-2) du
    \label{y}
\end{align}
\subsection{Q3.1}
Now, we are going to show if the system has 
a superposition property. To prove that we will show that
 $S\{a_1x_1(t)+a_2x_2(t)\}$ and $S\{a_1x_1(t)\}+
 S\{a_2x_2(t)\}$ give us same result. ($ x_1(t)$ and 
 $x_2(t)$ has been defined below)
 \begin{align}
    x_1(t) = u(t)-u(t-2) \label{x_1}\\
    x_2(t) = u(t)-u(t-3)
    \label{x_2}
\end{align}
\paragraph{}For implementing the system in Python we 
will do the same as the before. First, defining a 
function that has an input function and returns an 
output function with the use of lambda expression in 
Python. For the Integrating part of it, I have 
used \textbf{SciPy}. For importing the Integral, I 
have used the line below at the top of my code.
\begin{python}
import scipy.integrate as integrate
\end{python}
\paragraph{}The Implementation is straightforward 
(\textbf{Listing \ref{list:q3_1}}). I have chosen $a_1$ as 3 and 
$a_2$ as 2 and after defining the $x_1$ and $x_2$, 
$S\{a_1x_1(t)+a_2x_2(t)\}$ and $S\{a_1x_1(t)\}+ 
S\{a_2x_2(t)\}$ has been defined. Then they have 
plotted in a row and the result has been shown in 
the \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:Q3_1}}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Q3.2}

In the previous section, we have shown by example 
that the system of equation \ref{y} is Linear. In this
 section, we will show by example if the system is also
  \textbf{time-invariant}. Imagine $y_1(t)$ be the 
  response function of $x_1(t)$ in the equation 
  \ref{x_1} and $y_2(t)$ be the response function 
  of system to $x_1(t-3)$. We will show that both are 
  the same and this is in compliance with the 
  time-invariant property of the system.

\paragraph{}Implementation In python is also simple as 
it's shown in the \textbf{Listing \ref{list:q3_2}}. First the 
$y_1(t)$ and the $y_2(t)$ signal has been defined 
using $y$ system and $x_1$ signal that has been 
defined in \textbf{ Listing \ref{list:q3_1}} in the previous 
section. The result also has been shown in the 
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:Q3_2}}. As you can see, both of them 
are the same.

S\{a_2x_2(t)\}$}, label={list:q3_2}]{codes/Q3_2.py}

\end{figure}
\subsection{Q3.3}
In two previous sections, we have shown 
the \textbf{linearity} and \textbf{time-invariant}
 property of the system in equation \ref{y}. Although 
 we haven't proven those properties, we have shown 
 instances that comply with those. So we can say that 
 the system is \textbf{LTI}.
