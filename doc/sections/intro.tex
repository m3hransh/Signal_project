\section{introduction}

In this project, I have used two 
famous libraries in Python \textbf{Numpy} and 
\textbf{Matplotlib}. In this section I am going to give some 
summary about them.
\subsection{Numpy}
NumPy is a library for the Python programming 
language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional 
arrays and matrices, along with a large collection 
of high-level mathematical functions to operate on 
these arrays.
\subsection{Matplotlib}
Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python 
programming language and its numerical mathematics 
extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented 
API for embedding plots into applications using 
general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, 
wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.
