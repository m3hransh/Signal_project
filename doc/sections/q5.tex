\section{Convolution}
Convolution of signals $x_1[n]$ and $x_2[n]$ 
that symbolicly represented as $ x_1[n]*x_2[n]$ 
is as follow
\begin{align}
    y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty}x_1[k]x_2[n-k]
    \label{conv}
\end{align}
\subsection{Q5.1}
The implementation of equation 
(\ref{conv}) has been Shown as one-line lambda 
function in \textbf{Listing \ref{list:q5_1}}.

\subsection{Q5.2}

Consider signals $x_1[n]$ and $x_2[n]$ 
that has been defined below. Let's convolve them 
using the convolution function that we have defined 
in the previous section.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{8cm}}
    
    $x_1[n] = (\frac{1}{2^{-n+1}}).(u[n+2]-u[n-2])$\\
    \\
    $x_2[n] = \begin{cases}
        \sum_{k=-\infty}^{n}(sin(2k)+e^{j\pi k}).(u[k+3]-u[k-5]) &:0<n<7\\
        0 &: O.W
    \end{cases}$
\end{tabular}    
\end{center}
\paragraph{} The implementation has been shown in 
\textbf{Listing \ref{list:q5_2}}. After defining signals 
$x_1[n]$ and $x_2[n]$ they have been convolved 
using the \textbf{conv} function that returns 
the convolution as another function. and after 
that, they have been plotted. the result is in 
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:Q5_2}}.

\subsection{Q5.3}
In this section, we implement block convolution on 
two signals and compare them to the simple 
convolution to see if it works correctly. 
For block convolution, we first divide the 
signal to blocks and then convolve them separately 
and sum the results. consider following $x[n]$ that we
divide it to block with lenght of L.

\begin{align}
x[n] = \sum_{r=0}^{\infty}x_r[n-rL]
\end{align}
which $P>L$ and $x_r[n]$ is as following
\begin{align}
  x_r[n] = \begin{cases}
        x[n+rL] &:0<n<L-1\\
        0 &: O.W
    \end{cases}
\end{align}

For instance, we imply this in the following signals 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{8cm}}
    
    $x[n] = cos(n^2)sin(\frac{2\pi n}{5})$\\
    \\
    $h[n] = (0.9^n)(u[n] - u[n-10])$
\end{tabular}    
\end{center}
\paragraph{}Now first divide the signal x[n] with $L=50$ into 
two blocks, first block $x_0[n]$, second block $x_1[n]$.
Now we calculate $y_0[n] =x_0[n] * h[n]$ and $y_1[n] = x_1[n] 
* h[n]$. and using the equation below to calculate 
total convolution of $x[n]$ and $h[n]$.

\begin{align}
  y[n] = x[n] *h[n] = y_0[n] + y_1[n-L]
\end{align}



the implementation in Python has 
been shown in \textbf{Listing \ref{list:q5_3_1}}. After defining 
signals they convolved using \textbf{Numpy.convolve}.

\paragraph{}In the \textbf{Listing \ref{list:q5_3_2}} the 
signals that have been defined in \textbf{Listing \ref{list:q5_3_1}}, have been plotted using 
\textbf{plt.stem}. The result graph has been 
shown in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:Q5_3}}. As you can see, the 
total convolution and the block convolution that has 
calculated using the equation \ref{fig:Q5_3} are the same.
